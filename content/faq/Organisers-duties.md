#### 1. **What is the role of a working session organiser and what activities will I be responsible for?**

The role of working session organiser gives you the opportunity to create something special. The organiser's main responsibility is to create the most effective and productive working environment for the participants, including providing the vision for the working session content and outcomes. The energy you bring to your working session will impact its success.

#### 2. **How do I ensure a productive working session takes place?**

As the organiser, you should have a clear idea of what will happen during the session, as this will allow each session to produce something tangible and actionable.

Working session organisers should create detailed action plans and to-dos lists that are easy to pick up and start contributing to (we recommend you use GitHub Issues and Projects).

Each organiser should collaborate with the registered participants of their working session to identify and define what the ‘Outcomes’ of their working session(s) will be, these will affect the location and duration of that working session in the main Summit schedule.

Please add the outcomes to the appropriate working session in https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2019/tree/master/content/outcomes or email the outcomes@opensecsummit.org for support.

Don’t wait for the Summit to start thinking/sharing/working on either your working session or its outcomes.

#### 3.  Is any support available to me?

Two technical writers are available to support with preparing and finalising your outcomes. Robert Grace will be on-site, and Ann-Marie Grace will be available remotely. Contact them on [Slack] (https://os-summit.slack.com/messages/CK2RL3MAQ/details/) or email outcomes@opensecsummit.org with any queries.

#### 4. **Can you give me some examples of possible outcomes?**

Possible outcomes/deliverables include:

- *Diagrams*
- *Documents or Books*
- *Playbooks*
- *Roadmaps (for next meeting)*
- *Wiki pages (namely on owasp.org)*
- *Code*
- *Statement or Position (signed by the Working Sessions Participants)*
- *Security Review (or a particular application or api)*
- *Lessons Learned*

#### 5. **How long will we have to finalise the outcomes at the Summit?**

The sooner your outcomes are finalised, the sooner they will be published. All materials must be ready by the end of the day the session takes place.  

For reference, all materials need to be released under CC BY 4.0 or Apache 2.0 licenses.

#### 6. **When should I start defining the outcomes for my working session?**

The best way to achieve solid results at the Summit is to start on the working session's topics and outcomes before the Summit.

If you are a working session organiser, please start mapping the outcomes for your working session today!

Every working session has 'Outcomes' listed as a heading, and any working session that doesn’t have one will NOT be added to the main schedule and will not benefit from being part of the Summit participants' individual daily schedule.

Working materials will also be added to all working sessions, to allow both organisers and participants to consider and contribute draft materials.
