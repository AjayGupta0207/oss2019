## WHY

Develop new features and hacking challenges, beta-test those new challenges and improve the OWASP
Juice Shop project across the board.

## What

* _Builders_ work on functionality, bugfixes, new challenges, translations, documentation etc.
* _Breakers_ try to solve challenges, help fine-tune them and might even write some hints/solutions
* _Defenders_ use their own tools against the Juice Shop to see what they might miss and get ideas how to close gaps

## Outcomes

This working session can result in e.g.
* PRs being merged into the project's repositories on GitHub
* translations being improved on CrowdIn
* the companion guide eBook being extended and improved
